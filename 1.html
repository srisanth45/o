    <p>"My heart aches in the silence of your absence, my love. The days stretch like endless deserts, and every star in the night sky whispers your name. Memories of your laughter echo through my mind, like a song I can't forget. I miss the warmth of your touch, the spark in your eyes, and the way your presence filled the world with light. In your absence, my soul yearns, tethered to the hope of your return.
